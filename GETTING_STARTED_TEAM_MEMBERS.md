# Getting Started Team Members

This guide will outline the suggested team structure for the HighTechU Discord Bot.

## Team Structure

Each HighTechU Student will play an important role in the creation of your Discord Bot. Below you will find a list of roles and their respective tasks.

> Note: Each team will need at least 1 member per role. You may occupy more than 1 role, but every team member must contribute to the project!
>
> The admin role is the only role where only 1 team member is required.

### Admin Member

The admin member is in charge of creating the Discord Server, Discord Bot and setting up GitHub Pages, Heroku, and Firebase. This team member should be confident in their skills to manage accounts and distribute important information to teammates.

### Web Developer Member

The web developer member is in charge of modifying and updating/adding information on the Discord Bots landing page. They will help with branding and creating a logo for the Discord Bot.

### Bot Developer Member

The bot developer member is in charge of modifying and updating/adding code for the Discord Bot. They will help test and add features to the bot.

### Business Member

The business member is in charge of cultivating the minimum viable product of the Discord Bot into a digestible format. They will help create the Discord Bot Pitch and help delegate tasks and priorities.

## Conclusion

Each HighTechU Student will assume one or more roles in order to contribute to the project.

> Note: There can be more than one web developer, bot developer, and business member in each team.
>
> HighTechU Students can also assume more than one role. Feel free to experiment with different roles. This is a learning experience!
