# Getting Started Website

This guide will help you get started with the project's website. 

## More Information

The project's website will be a landing page for your Discord Bot. Users will be able to add your Discord Bot to their server from the website and be able to view all the available features and commands.

The template website can be viewed [here](https://hightechu.github.io/hightechu-discord-bot/).

You will want to create a website that reflects your Discord Bots Branding.

The website uses Bootstrap for styling. You will want to read the Bootstrap Documentation when creating your website. For more information, visit "[Bootstrap Introduction](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)".

## Website Set Up

The website is located in the repository in the `docs` folder. You can access the folder [here](./docs/).

To set up GitHub Pages, you will need admin access to the repository. You will set up GitHub Pages with `./docs` as the `Source`. For more information, visit "[Creating a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)".

> Note: HighTechU Students working in a team will have 1 team member with admin access.

## Publishing

The website will automatically be deployed when the `main` branch is updated. Once deployed, GitHub will provide you with a URL. Anyone with the URL can visit the website.

## Development

To develop the website, you will need to clone the repository into your development environment. For more information about getting started with the project repository, visit "[getting started](./GETTING_STARTED.md)".
